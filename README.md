# Amogus-Sus-Audio
Just run the file and the Among Us Sus Audio will automatically play!


Open sus.exe and run it. The audio will automatically play and save a sound file to the path where it is ran. If sus.exe is closed, the audio will stop. 
This is currently under active development and will be improved in the future!
